# Terraform scripts for financial-portfolio

This repo contains the terraform scripts used to manage the infrastructure for deploying the financial-portfolio application.  *.tfvars files are included in the .gitignore as my implementation uses terraform cloud for deployments and variables storage.

The starting point for this repo code is from here <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/gke?in=terraform/kubernetes&utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS&_ga=2.11245172.117171549.1641140924-1445234834.1641140924">Provision a GKE Cluster (Google Cloud)</a>.
